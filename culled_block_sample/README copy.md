# Minecraft Block Culling

This sample demonstrates how to use block culling on the **tuna_roll** custom block. 

After downloading these add-on packs:

1. Insert UUIDs in the manifests.
1. Put them in their respective folders in your com.Mojang folder.
1. Make a creative Minecraft world.
1. `/give @s demo:tuna_roll`
1. Place 3 tuna roll blocks.
1. Replace the center block with a full-sized block like "acacia planks".
1. You will see the geometry of the tuna roll blocks change.
